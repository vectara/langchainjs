# Add message history (memory)

The `RunnableWithMessageHistory` let's us add message history to certain types of chains.

Specifically, it can be used for any Runnable that takes as input one of

- a list of `BaseMessage`
- an object with a key that takes a list of `BaseMessage`
- an object with a key that takes the latest message(s) as a string or list of `BaseMessage`, and a separate key that takes historical messages

And returns as output one of

- a string that can be treated as the contents of an `AIMessage`
- a list of `BaseMessage`
- an object with a key that contains a list of `BaseMessage`

Let's take a look at some examples to see how it works.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>

## Pass config through the constructor

You don't always have to pass the `config` object through the `invoke` method. `RunnableWithMessageHistory` supports passing it through the constructor as well.

To do this, the only change you need to make is remove the second arg (or just the `configurable` key from the second arg) from the `invoke` method, and add it in through the `config` key in the constructor.

This is a simple example building on top of what we have above:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ExampleConstructorConfig}</CodeBlock>
