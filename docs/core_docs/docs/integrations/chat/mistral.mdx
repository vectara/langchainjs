# ChatMistralAI

[Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) is a research organization and hosting platform for LLMs.
They're most known for their family of 7B models ([`mistral7b` // `mistral-tiny`](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/), [`mixtral8x7b` // `mistral-small`](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/)).

The LangChain implementation of Mistral's models uses their hosted generation API, making it easier to access their models without needing to run them locally.

## Models

Mistral's API offers access to two of their models: `mistral7b` and `mixtral8x7b`. You can access these through the API by using their model names:

- `mistral7b` -> `mistral-tiny`
- `mixtral8x7b` -> `mistral-small`

## Setup

In order to use the Mistral API you'll need an API key. You can sign up for a Mistral account and create an API key [here](https://console.mistral.ai/).

You'll first need to install the [`@langchain/mistralai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/mistralai) package:

:::tip
See [this section for general instructions on installing integration packages](/docs/get_started/installation#installing-integration-packages).
:::

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @langchain/mistralai
```

## Usage

When sending chat messages to mistral, there are a few requirements to follow:

- The first message can _*not*_ be an assistant (ai) message.
- Messages _*must*_ alternate between user and assistant (ai) messages.
- Messages can _*not*_ end with an assistant (ai) or system message.

### Streaming

Mistral's API also supports streaming token responses. The example below demonstrates how to use this feature.
