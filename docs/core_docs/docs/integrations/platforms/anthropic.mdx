All functionality related to Anthropic models.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude.
This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain.

## Prompting Overview

Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data.
However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string.
It expects this string to be in a particular format.
This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case.
LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write -
whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly.

Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue
between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain
`\n\nHuman:` and `\n\nAssistant:` as the signals of who's speaking.
The final turn must always be `\n\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\n\nHuman:` as the final role.

Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`.
This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`.
It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below).
This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to).
However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well.
The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`.

## Prompting Best Practices

Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models.

**System Messages may only be the first message**

Anthropic models require any system messages to be the first one in your prompts.

## `ChatAnthropic`

`ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain's `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`.
You can import this wrapper with the following code:

```typescript
import { ChatAnthropic } from "langchain/chat_models/anthropic";
const model = new ChatAnthropic({});
```

When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s.
Here is an example below of doing that:

```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "langchain/prompts";

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["system", "You are a helpful chatbot"],
  ["human", "Tell me a joke about {topic}"],
]);
```

You can then use this in a chain as follows:

```typescript
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
await chain.invoke({ topic: "bears" });
```
