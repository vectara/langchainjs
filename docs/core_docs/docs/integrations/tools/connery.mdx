# Connery Actions Tool

Using this tool, you can integrate individual Connery actions into your LangChain agents and chains.

## What is Connery?

Connery is an open-source plugin infrastructure for AI.

With Connery, you can easily create a custom plugin, which is essentially a set of actions, and use them in your LangChain agents and chains.
Connery will handle the rest: runtime, authorization, secret management, access management, audit logs, and other vital features.
Also, you can find a lot of ready-to-use plugins from our community.
