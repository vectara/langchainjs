:::warning
This tool executes code and can potentially perform destructive actions. Be careful that you trust any code passed to it!
:::

LangChain offers an experimental tool for executing arbitrary Python code.
This can be useful in combination with an LLM that can generate code to perform more powerful computations.

## Usage

import ToolExample from "@examples/tools/pyinterpreter.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{ToolExample}</CodeBlock>
