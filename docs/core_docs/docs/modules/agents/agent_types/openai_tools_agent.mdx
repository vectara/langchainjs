# OpenAI tool calling

:::tip Compatibility
Tool calling is new and only available on [OpenAI's latest models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).
:::

OpenAI's latest `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` and `gpt-4-1106-preview` models have been fine-tuned to detect when one or more tools should be called to gather sufficient information
to answer the initial query, and respond with the inputs that should be passed to those tools.

While the goal of more reliably returning valid and useful function calls is the same as the functions agent, the ability to return multiple tools at once results in
both fewer roundtrips for complex questions.

The OpenAI Tools Agent is designed to work with these models.

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import RunnableExample from "@examples/agents/openai_tools_runnable.ts";

# Usage

In this example we'll use LCEL to construct a customizable agent with a mocked weather tool and a calculator.

The basic flow is this:

1. Define the tools the agent will be able to call. You can use [OpenAI's tool syntax](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling), or LangChain tool instances as shown below.
2. Initialize our model and bind those tools as arguments.
3. Define a function that formats any previous agent steps as messages. The agent will pass those back to OpenAI for the next agent iteration.
4. Create a `RunnableSequence` that will act as the agent. We use a specialized output parser to extract any tool calls from the model's output.
5. Initialize an `AgentExecutor` with the agent and the tools to execute the agent on a loop.
6. Run the `AgentExecutor` and see the output.

Here's how it looks:

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{RunnableExample}</CodeBlock>

## Adding memory

We can also use memory to save our previous agent input/outputs, and pass it through to each agent iteration.
Using memory can help give the agent better context on past interactions, which can lead to more accurate responses beyond what the `agent_scratchpad` can do.

Adding memory only requires a few changes to the above example.

First, import and instantiate your memory class, in this example we'll use `BufferMemory`.

```typescript
import { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";
```

```typescript
const memory = new BufferMemory({
  memoryKey: "history", // The object key to store the memory under
  inputKey: "question", // The object key for the input
  outputKey: "answer", // The object key for the output
  returnMessages: true,
});
```

Then, update your prompt to include another `MessagesPlaceholder`. This time we'll be passing in the `chat_history` variable from memory.

```typescript
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
  ["ai", "You are a helpful assistant."],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
  ["human", "{input}"],
  new MessagesPlaceholder("agent_scratchpad"),
]);
```

Next, inside your `RunnableSequence` add a field for loading the `chat_history` from memory.

```typescript
const runnableAgent = RunnableSequence.from([
  {
    input: (i: { input: string; steps: ToolsAgentStep[] }) => i.input,
    agent_scratchpad: (i: { input: string; steps: ToolsAgentStep[] }) =>
      formatToOpenAIToolMessages(i.steps),
    // Load memory here
    chat_history: async (_: { input: string; steps: ToolsAgentStep[] }) => {
      const { history } = await memory.loadMemoryVariables({});
      return history;
    },
  },
  prompt,
  modelWithTools,
  new OpenAIToolsAgentOutputParser(),
]).withConfig({ runName: "OpenAIToolsAgent" });
```

Finally we can call the agent, and save the output after the response is returned.

```typescript
const executor = AgentExecutor.fromAgentAndTools({
  agent: runnableAgent,
  tools,
});

const query =
  "What is the sum of the current temperature in San Francisco, New York, and Tokyo?";

console.log(`Calling agent executor with query: ${query}`);

const result = await executor.invoke({
  input: query,
});

console.log(result);

/*
  Calling agent executor with query: What is the weather in New York?
  {
    output: 'The current weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit. The humidity is at 54% and the wind is blowing at 6 mph. There is 0% chance of precipitation.'
  }
*/

// Save the result and initial input to memory
await memory.saveContext(
  {
    question: query,
  },
  {
    answer: result.output,
  }
);

const query2 = "Do I need a jacket in New York?";

const result2 = await executor.invoke({
  input: query2,
});
console.log(result2);
/*
  {
    output: 'The sum of the current temperatures in San Francisco, New York, and Tokyo is 104 degrees.'
  }
  {
    output: "The current temperature in New York is 22Â°C. It's a bit chilly, so you may want to bring a jacket with you."
  }
*/
```
