# Access intermediate steps

In order to get more visibility into what an agent is doing, we can also return intermediate steps. This comes in the form of an extra key in the return value.

All you need to do is initialize the AgentExecutor with `return_intermediate_steps=True`:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/agents/intermediate_steps.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
