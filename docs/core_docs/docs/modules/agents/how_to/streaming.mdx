# Streaming

Streaming is an important UX consideration for LLM apps, and agents are no exception. Streaming with agents is made more complicated by the fact that it’s not just tokens that you will want to stream, but you may also want to stream back the intermediate steps an agent takes.

Let’s take a look at how to do this.

## Streaming intermediate steps

Let’s look at how to stream intermediate steps. We can do this by using the default `.stream()` method on the AgentExecutor.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamIntermediateStepsExample}</CodeBlock>

You can see that we get back a bunch of different information. There are two ways to work with this information:

1. By using the AgentAction or observation directly
2. By using the messages object

## Streaming tokens

In addition to streaming the final result, you can also stream tokens from each individual step. This will require more complex parsing of the logs.

Note: You will also need to make sure you set the LLM to return streaming output to get the maximum amount of data possible.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{StreamLogExample}</CodeBlock>

With some creative parsing, this can be useful for e.g. streaming back just the final response from the agent:

```typescript
const logStream = await agentExecutor.streamLog({
  input: "what is the weather in SF",
});

/*
  Final streamed output from the OpenAI functions agent will look similar to the below chunk
  since intermediate steps are streamed functions rather than strings:

  {
    "ops": [
      {
        "op": "add",
        "path": "/logs/ChatOpenAI:2/streamed_output_str/-",
        "value": "anc"
      }
    ]
  }
*/

for await (const chunk of logStream) {
  if (chunk.ops?.length > 0 && chunk.ops[0].op === "add") {
    const addOp = chunk.ops[0];
    if (
      addOp.path.startsWith("/logs/ChatOpenAI") &&
      typeof addOp.value === "string" &&
      addOp.value.length
    ) {
      console.log(addOp.value);
    }
  }
}
