# Streaming

Agents have the ability to stream iterations and actions back while they're still working.
This can be very useful for any realtime application where you have users who need insights on the agent's progress while is has yet to finish.

Setting up streaming with agents is very simple, even with existing agents. The only change required is switching your `executor.invoke({})` to be `executor.stream({})`.

Below is a simple example of streaming with an agent.
