# Toolkits

Toolkits are collections of tools that are designed to be used together for specific tasks and have convenient loading methods.
For a complete list of these, visit the section in [Integrations](/docs/integrations/toolkits).

All Toolkits expose a `getTools()` method which returns a list of tools. You could therefore do:

```typescript
// Initialize a toolkit
const toolkit = new ExampleTookit(...);

// Get list of tools
const tools = toolkit.getTools();

// Create agent
const agent = createAgentMethod({ llm, tools, prompt });
```
