# langchainjs-integration-template

Template repo for [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs) integration packages.

## Usage

Source code lives in the `src/` directory.

By default, there is a single entrypoint under `langchain_integration/src/index.ts` that you should re-export all relevant classes and functions from.
If you want to add more entrypoints, add them in `langchain_integration/scripts/create-entrypoints.js`.

To build your source code, run the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

The build process will automatically create build artifacts for both ESM and CJS.

Note that because of the way compiled files are created and ignored, the `.gitignore` will be dynamically generated by `scripts/create-entrypoints.js` whenever you run `yarn build`.
This means that if you want to add more ignored files, you'll need to add them under `DEFAULT_GITIGNORE_PATHS` in that script.

After running `yarn build`, publish a new version with:

```bash
$ npm publish
```

Prettier and ESLint are also configured:

```bash
$ yarn format
$ yarn lint
```

As well as Jest for testing. Test files should live within a `tests/` file in the `src/` folder. Unit tests should end in `.test.ts` and integration tests should
end in `.int.test.ts`:

```bash
$ yarn test
$ yarn test:int
```
