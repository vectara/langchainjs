  # Function calling
  
  A growing number of chat models, like
  [OpenAI](${link1}),
  [Mistral](${link2}),
  etc., have a function-calling API that lets you describe functions and
  their arguments, and have the model return a JSON object with a function
  to invoke and the inputs to that function. Function-calling is extremely
  useful for building [tool-using chains and
  agents](${link3}), and for getting
  structured outputs from models more generally.`;
